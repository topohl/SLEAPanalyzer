SLEAP/DLC Tracking Data Analysis with Modified DLCanalyzer

This project provides a modified version of the DLCanalyzer R package that supports the analysis of SLEAP/DLC tracking data. Additionally, this project adds functionality to DLCanalyzer that is not provided out of the box.

Overview

DLCanalyzer is a powerful tool for analyzing and visualizing tracking data from various animal behavioral tests, written in R. However, it only supports analyzing data acquired using DeepLabCut. This project extends the functionality of DLCanalyzer to support analyzing tracking data acquired using SLEAP.

In addition to SLEAP support, this project adds custom analyses to DLCanalyzer that are not provided out of the box. This allows researchers to perform more advanced analyses using the DLCanalyzer framework.
